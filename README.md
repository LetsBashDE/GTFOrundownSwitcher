# GTFOrundownSwitcher
TLDR: A very small script that let you change your rundown in a second

## Installation
You basicly need the backups of your gtfo game folders in your steam
"steamapps\common" folder named like "GTFO + Number of the rundown". 

For Example: GTFO1 for Rundown 1, GTFO2 for Rundown 2, ...and so on
             ...up to the latest rundown named GTFO without a number

Again: If you have all Rundowns then you should have this Game folders
in your "steamapps\common" folder: GTFO, GTFO1, GTFO2, GTFO3, GTFO4 and GTFO5in your

After you have placed your rundown folders in your your "steamapps\common" folder
you have to define the path to your "steamapps\common" folder in the script.

## How to use
1. Launch this scriptfile and leave the window open. 
   (Window should say run game by steam)
2. Launch the game by steam
3. Play your rundown
4. Exit GTFO as usual and let the window of this script still open
5. The script detects automaticly that you closed the window and will 
   cleanup any folder renamings
